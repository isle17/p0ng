6/22/2021 - Finished my version of pong
At the end of coding my pong game I reviewed the instructor's code and found that I was making things excedingly complicated. For example she uses one Turtle() object adjusted to a certain height and width, for the paddle while I used 5 separate Turtle() objects copying what we did in the previous snake assignment. If this lesson has taught me anything it is to REVIEW DOCUMENTATION before starting a project. I have not yet seen how she calculated angles but it will be eye opening.
